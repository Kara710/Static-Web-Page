			<h2>Native Trees I Chose for My Arid Southwestern Property</h2>
			<p>By Renée Benoit<br>What is all too common is people plant their trees too close to the house. They don’t realize how big that cute little tree in the nursery is going to get. We have that problem with a 40-foot Arizona Cypress that is about 3 feet from the foundation of the house. It’s going to be a sad day indeed when we have to cut it down. It was pruned way back on the house side because it rubbed the roof and destroyed shingles and underlayment. Please read up on the attributes of a tree before buying it. Yes, it would be cute to have it next to the house while it’s little but when it’s big you will be sorry.</p>

			<h2>Live Well with Nature</h2>
			<p>By Mother Earth News readers<br>
				My wife, Dianna, and I moved into our newly constructed lake home in late 1995. The land was a blank slate of muddy clay. I loved writing on it. I designed the entire landscape for our yard, first on paper, and then, with plenty of sweat, in the earth.
				I built sandstone walls to break up the steep slope of the property, tossed in a few rock piles here and there, and added seven trembling aspen to the south side of the house for shade in summer. I also added a variety of evergreens on the north side to block the arctic winter winds. I created lots of islands for plants, along with a 20-by-40-foot vegetable garden. I planted all of it myself.
				Dianna’s idea of a perfect landscape was every plant in its own place, with lots of space around each one, which equals lots of mulch — up to 150 bags or more every other year. Still, we spent many summer hours in the yard pulling “weeds,” which, of course, always came right back.
				Fortunately, I realized right away we didn’t need a sprinkler system — even though everyone else on the block had one — because the ground was 100 percent clay. The grass was happy if I cut it high, and, once established, it didn’t need water, fertilizer, or herbicides. In the 25 years I’ve lived here, the grass has gone brown (dormant) a couple of times, but always comes back as good as ever.

			<h3>Atmosphere</h3>
			<p>
			Global warming reduces the capacity of the oceans to absorb oxygen. Biomarkers and geologic evidence suggests that oxygen-deprived oceans resulting from high carbon dioxide concentrations may have contributed to the five previous mass extinction events in Earth's history. Geoscientists have found that anaerobic microbes would have thrived in these conditions and produced vast amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas. Hydrogen sulfide is toxic, and its lethality increases with temperature. At a critical threshold, this toxic gas would have been released into the atmosphere, causing plant and animal extinctions both in the ocean and on land. Models suggest that this would also have damaged the ozone layer, exposing life on Earth to harmful levels of UV radiation. Deformities found in fossil spores in Greenland provides evidence that this may have occurred during the Permian extinction event.

			<h3>Disease</h3>
			<p>
			Rising temperatures increase the risk of an epidemic or pandemic. As the climate changes, distributors of infectious diseases such as mosquitoes and ticks spread to new areas and transmit illnesses to regions which may not have experienced them otherwise. Epidemics are also made more likely after severe weather events, such as heavy rainfall or flooding. Food scarcity may lead some communities to a more meat-based diet, which raises the risk of outbreaks of diseases such as ebola. Melting permafrost also threatens to release diseases that have been dormant for many years, as was the case in August 2016.

			<h3>Food scarcity</h3>
			<p>
			Many plants have a maximum temperature at which they can grow, and climate change may mean that new pests are introduced to areas where it was too cold for them to survive before. Extreme weather events and more frequent droughts will also affect crop production as the Earth approaches and surpasses 2°C (3.6°F) above pre-industrial levels. A global decline in food availability could lead to severe impacts on public health. If the Earth's temperature increases to 2°C above pre-industrial levels by 2050, some models predict that global food availability would be 3.2 percent lower than if no climate change occurred, resulting in an additional 529,000 deaths worldwide.

			<h3>Natural disasters</h3>
			<p>
			Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events including droughts, storms and flooding. Although it is not possible to determine whether or not a specific natural disaster occurred because of climate change, it is possible to state how much more likely a natural disaster was as a result of climate change.
